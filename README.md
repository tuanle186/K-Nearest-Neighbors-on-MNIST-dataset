# Processing MNIST dataset and implementing kNN algorithm using List ADT

Classification is one of the fundamental and most common tasks in machine learning. The goal of classification is to categorize data into different groups (classes) based on their characteristics. Some simple examples of classification problems include classifying emails as spam or non-spam, classifying images as cat or dog, and so on. In this assignment, students will become acquainted with the simple classification algorithm k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and apply this algorithm to process and classify the MNIST dataset.

In this project, I work on the C++ implementation of a class that provides users with the ability to process the MNIST dataset, as well as a class that efficiently implements the kNN classification algorithm using list data structures.
